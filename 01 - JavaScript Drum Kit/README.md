# Drum Kit - Vanilla JavaScript Project

It a really sweet JavaScript Drum Kit and it's very fun to play.
When you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it's going to do two things:

- First of all, it's going to play the sound that's associated with that key and
- Second of all going to do a short little animation where it pops the button up to be a little bit bigger than we want.
  And then also it will apply the yellow border and a little background there.
